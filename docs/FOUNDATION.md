## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Two-Actor Model - Session Execution Methodology

### 🎭 Two Actors, Clear Roles

**Claude Chat = The Architect** (Instructions Only)
- Provides clear, detailed instructions
- NEVER writes actual code
- NEVER uses cat/EOF commands
- NEVER creates artifacts
- Trusts Claude Code completely

**Claude Code = The Builder** (Implementation Only)
- Receives instructions
- Writes all code
- Handles all file operations
- Executes everything in ONE script
- Reports back results

### ❌ WRONG Approach (Claude Chat Writing Code)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "Here's the code:

cat > validator.js << 'EOF'
function validate() {
  // validation logic
}
EOF

Now run this command..."
```
**This is WRONG! Chat should NEVER write code!**

### ✅ RIGHT Approach (Claude Chat Giving Instructions)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "I need you to execute a comprehensive script that:

1. Creates src/validation/validator.js with:
   - A BootstrapValidator class
   - Test methods for project structure
   - Git integration checks
   - Google Drive sync verification
   - Report generation

2. Creates tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh as executable

3. Runs the validation and captures results

4. Updates Foundation document with results

5. Commits everything with descriptive message"
```
**This is RIGHT! Chat provides clear instructions, Code implements!**

## 📋 Project Overview
**Mission**: Build a personal development velocity platform that achieves speed through perfection
**Platform**: Local Mac application with cloud-primary storage
**Method**: Zero-error sessions via Two-Actor Model (Chat instructs, Code implements)
**Status**: Foundation established with validation framework

## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

### The Two-Actor Model IS SessionHub

SessionHub doesn't just use the Two-Actor Model for development - it embodies it as its core architecture. As a local Mac application, SessionHub runs entirely on your machine while leveraging cloud services for intelligence and persistence:

- **Planning Actor** (Claude Chat API): Analyzes, strategizes, and generates instructions
- **Execution Actor** (Claude Code): Implements, builds, and executes tasks

This separation is fundamental to how SessionHub operates locally:

1. When users request work, SessionHub's Planning Engine (running locally) calls Claude API to create instructions
2. SessionHub's Execution Engine (local process) implements those instructions on your Mac
3. All communication happens through a strict Instruction Protocol
4. The system enforces separation - planning modules cannot execute, execution modules cannot strategize
5. Results are stored in Supabase for cross-project learning while maintaining local performance

### Architectural Implementation Roadmap

- **Session 0.4**: Core Two-Actor Architecture ✅
  - Planning Engine with Claude API integration
  - Execution Engine with Claude Code runner
  - Instruction Protocol definition
  - Architectural enforcement mechanisms

- **Session 0.5**: Orchestration & API Integration ✅
  - Complete orchestration layer
  - Real Claude API integration
  - Session management and workflow
  - Production-ready architecture

- **Session 0.6**: Local Installation & Setup
  - Mac app packaging and distribution
  - Menu bar and dock integration
  - Auto-update mechanism
  - Local security (code signing, notarization)
  - macOS permissions handling

- **Session 0.7**: Cloud-Primary Data Persistence with Local Cache
  - Supabase as primary database for all sessions
  - Local SQLite for offline work and caching
  - Sync strategy between local and cloud
  - Cross-project pattern recognition via cloud data
  - Planning Actor accesses vast cloud history

- **Session 0.8**: Mac System & Platform Integration ✅
  - Deep macOS integration (file system, notifications)
  - Apple Silicon optimization
  - Keychain integration for credentials
  - External service connectors (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
  - Local process and shell management

- **Session 0.9**: Self-Development Infrastructure
  - SessionHub development instance setup
  - Self-update pipeline implementation
  - Issue-to-session workflow automation
  - Development environment isolation
  - Emergency recovery procedures

- **Session 0.10**: Self-Development Validation
  - Comprehensive testing of self-development capabilities
  - Validation of update mechanisms
  - Emergency procedure verification
  - Production readiness assessment

### Why This Matters

This isn't just methodology - it's architecture. SessionHub will:
- Refuse to let planning components write code
- Refuse to let execution components make strategic decisions  
- Validate every instruction before execution
- Self-document through its structure

The result: A system that demonstrates its own best practices through its architecture.

## ✅ SESSION 2.29.2G: MODULE RESOLUTION FIX FOR FIRST LAUNCH

**MILESTONE: Application Launch Issue Resolved!**

### ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE (2025-06-13)

**Issue**: Module resolution errors preventing SessionHub from launching successfully after production build.

### 🔧 **Key Fixes Implemented**

**Module Path Resolution**
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript path aliases (`@/`) in compiled Electron code
- ✅ Converted ClaudeAPIClient imports from `@/src/lib/logging/Logger` to relative path `../logging/Logger`
- ✅ Fixed SupabaseService imports for MacKeychainService and related modules
- ✅ Updated all path aliases to relative imports for Electron compilation

**Build Process Enhancement**
- ✅ Electron compilation now completes without TypeScript errors
- ✅ All modules properly resolved in dist directory structure
- ✅ Update-checker module working correctly (was not the actual issue)
- ✅ Application launches successfully without module errors

**Validation Results**
- ✅ SessionHub launches without module resolution errors
- ✅ All Electron processes running correctly (main + renderer)
- ✅ Update checker loads and functions properly
- ✅ First run experience successful
- ✅ All core features accessible after launch

### 📋 **Resolution Summary**

The issue was not with the update-checker module itself, but with TypeScript path alias resolution in the compiled JavaScript. The Electron build process was not resolving `@/` path aliases, causing require() failures at runtime. Fixed by converting all problematic imports to relative paths.

**Key Changes:**
- `src/lib/api/ClaudeAPIClient.ts`: Fixed Logger and APIUsageTracker imports
- `src/services/cloud/SupabaseService.ts`: Fixed MacKeychainService and related imports
- Electron compilation now generates correct CommonJS require paths
- Application launches cleanly with all modules resolved

### 🎯 **Success Criteria Achieved**

- ✅ Zero module resolution errors
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly  
- ✅ No missing dependencies
- ✅ Build process includes all files
- ✅ Application stability verified
- ✅ Error handling for optional modules
- ✅ Clean launch achieved
- ✅ Ready for production use

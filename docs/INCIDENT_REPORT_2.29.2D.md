# Incident Report: Terminal Memory Explosion
## Session 2.29.2D - Emergency Recovery

### Incident Summary
- **Date**: June 13, 2025
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Impact**: Complete system crash requiring reboot
- **Root Cause**: Electron build process memory leak causing Terminal to consume 138GB

### Timeline
1. **Build Initiated**: Standard Electron build command executed
2. **Memory Spike**: Terminal process memory usage exploded to 138GB
3. **System Crash**: macOS became unresponsive, requiring hard reboot
4. **Recovery**: System rebooted after 5 minutes

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Factors
1. **Unbounded Build Process**: Electron builder spawned multiple processes without memory limits
2. **Terminal Buffer Overflow**: Build output accumulated in Terminal history (138GB)
3. **Missing Resource Constraints**: No memory limits on Node.js processes
4. **Large Build Artifacts**: 509MB mac-arm64 directory, 155MB zip files

#### Contributing Factors
- Webpack bundle analysis generating massive output
- Source map generation consuming excessive memory
- Multiple concurrent build processes
- No cleanup of previous build artifacts

### Immediate Actions Taken
1. **System Cleanup**
   - Removed Terminal cache and history
   - Cleaned build artifacts (dist-electron, out directories)
   - Removed and reinstalled node_modules with constraints

2. **Process Termination**
   - Verified no lingering Node/Electron processes
   - Cleared npm cache

3. **Disk Space Recovery**
   - Freed ~1.5GB by removing build artifacts
   - Cleaned Terminal caches

### Preventive Measures Implemented

#### 1. Memory-Safe Build Script (`scripts/memory-safe-build.sh`)
- Enforces 4GB memory limit for renderer build
- Enforces 2GB memory limit for main process
- Monitors memory usage every 5 seconds
- Auto-terminates if limits exceeded

#### 2. Incremental Build Strategy (`scripts/incremental-build.sh`)
- Builds pages separately to reduce memory load
- TypeScript compilation isolated
- Bundle generation in steps
- Maximum 2GB per process

#### 3. Build Monitor (`scripts/build-monitor.sh`)
- Real-time memory and disk monitoring
- Automatic process termination on threshold breach
- Emergency cleanup procedures
- Detailed logging for analysis

### Configuration Changes
1. **Node Options**: Added `--max-old-space-size` limits
2. **Build Process**: Split into smaller, manageable chunks
3. **Monitoring**: Active resource monitoring during builds

### Lessons Learned
1. **Never run builds without memory constraints**
2. **Terminal output can accumulate to extreme sizes**
3. **Monitor system resources during intensive operations**
4. **Implement fail-safes before they're needed**

### Future Recommendations
1. Consider using build servers or CI/CD for production builds
2. Implement build caching to reduce repeated work
3. Use cloud build services for resource-intensive operations
4. Regular cleanup of build artifacts and caches

### Recovery Validation
- ✅ System memory usage normal (6GB free)
- ✅ No lingering processes
- ✅ Build artifacts cleaned
- ✅ Dependencies reinstalled
- ✅ Safe build scripts created
- ✅ Monitoring systems in place

### Commands for Safe Building
```bash
# Option 1: Memory-safe build with monitoring
./scripts/build-monitor.sh &
./scripts/memory-safe-build.sh

# Option 2: Incremental build
./scripts/incremental-build.sh

# Option 3: Manual with constraints
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run build
```

### Status
**RESOLVED** - System recovered, safe build processes implemented

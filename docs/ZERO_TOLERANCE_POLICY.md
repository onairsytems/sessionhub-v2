# SessionHub Zero-Tolerance Error Policy

**Version:** 0.1.4  
**Status:** EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT  
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-07

## Executive Summary

This document establishes SessionHub's **ZERO-TOLERANCE** policy for code quality and error handling. Any attempt to bypass quality gates is considered a critical security violation and will be logged, blocked, and reported.

## Core Principles

1. **No Errors Allowed**: TypeScript errors, ESLint warnings, and build failures must be fixed before proceeding
2. **No Bypassing**: All quality gates are mandatory and cannot be skipped
3. **Full Transparency**: All bypass attempts are logged and monitored
4. **Automatic Enforcement**: Systems actively prevent workarounds

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Git Hook Protection

- **Pre-commit Hook**: Validates TypeScript, ESLint, and runs tests
- **Post-commit Hook**: Verifies commit quality after the fact
- **Git Wrapper**: Blocks `--no-verify` and similar bypass flags
- **Audit Trail**: All git commands logged to `~/.sessionhub/git-audit.log`

### 2. TypeScript Enforcement

- **Strict Mode**: All TypeScript configs enforced to use strict settings
- **Config Guardian**: Automatically reverts any attempts to weaken TypeScript settings
- **Build-time Checks**: TypeScript errors block all builds
- **No Suppressions**: `@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, and `@ts-expect-error` are prohibited

### 3. Build System Protection

- **Validation First**: All builds require validation to pass
- **Zero Warnings**: ESLint configured with `--max-warnings 0`
- **Error Detection**: Custom error detection system runs on every build
- **Post-build Verification**: Ensures build outputs meet quality standards

### 4. Monitoring and Alerts

- **Bypass Monitor**: Runs continuously to detect bypass attempts
- **Real-time Alerts**: Critical violations trigger system notifications
- **Security Reports**: Weekly reports generated automatically
- **Violation Logs**: All attempts logged with timestamp, user, and details

## Prohibited Actions

The following actions are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**:

1. Using `git commit --no-verify` or `-n` flag
2. Setting `HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=1` or similar environment variables
3. Modifying TypeScript configs to disable strict mode
4. Adding error suppression comments (`@ts-ignore`, `eslint-disable`)
5. Force pushing without fixing errors
6. Modifying git hook configurations
7. Attempting to disable or bypass the monitoring system

## Consequences

Bypass attempts will result in:

1. **Immediate Block**: The action will be prevented
2. **Logging**: Attempt recorded with full details
3. **Alert**: System notification sent (on supported platforms)
4. **Report**: Included in security reports
5. **Review**: Patterns of attempts will be analyzed

## Setup Instructions

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Run the zero-tolerance setup
npm run zero-tolerance:setup

# Source the enforcement environment
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
source .env.zero-tolerance
```

### Verification

```bash
# Verify TypeScript configs
npm run tsconfig:validate

# Check error detection
npm run error:check

# Start the bypass monitor
npm run bypass:monitor
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# View git audit log
tail -f ~/.sessionhub/git-audit.log

# View bypass attempts
cat ~/.sessionhub/bypass-attempts.log

# Generate security report
cat ~/.sessionhub/security-report.md
```

## Developer Guidelines

1. **Fix Errors Immediately**: Don't accumulate technical debt
2. **Never Suppress Warnings**: Address the root cause
3. **Test Before Commit**: Ensure all checks pass locally
4. **Review Error Messages**: They provide valuable guidance
5. **Ask for Help**: If stuck on an error, seek assistance

├── setup-zero-tolerance.sh  # Initial setup script
├── tsconfig-guardian.ts     # TypeScript config enforcer
├── start-bypass-monitor.ts  # Monitoring service

├── pre-commit              # Enhanced pre-commit hook
└── post-commit             # Post-commit verification
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
HUSKY=1                    # Forces hook execution
HUSKY_SKIP_HOOKS=0        # Prevents skipping
SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=0    # No preflight skipping
CI=0                      # Prevents CI bypass
```

## Emergency Procedures

If you encounter a critical issue:

1. **Do NOT attempt to bypass** - This will be detected and logged
2. **Document the issue** - Create a detailed report
3. **Seek immediate help** - Contact the team lead
4. **Follow proper channels** - Use approved emergency procedures

## Compliance

This policy is:
- **Mandatory** for all developers
- **Non-negotiable** in its enforcement
- **Automatically enforced** by multiple systems
- **Continuously monitored** for compliance

## Version History

- **0.1.4** (2025-01-07): Emergency implementation of zero-tolerance policy
- **0.1.3** (Previous): Standard error detection without strict enforcement

**Remember**: Quality is not optional. Every error matters. Every bypass is detected.

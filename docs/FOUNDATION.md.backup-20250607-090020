## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Two-Actor Model - Session Execution Methodology

### 🎭 Two Actors, Clear Roles

**Claude Chat = The Architect** (Instructions Only)
- Provides clear, detailed instructions
- NEVER writes actual code
- NEVER uses cat/EOF commands
- NEVER creates artifacts
- Trusts Claude Code completely

**Claude Code = The Builder** (Implementation Only)
- Receives instructions
- Writes all code
- Handles all file operations
- Executes everything in ONE script
- Reports back results

### ❌ WRONG Approach (Claude Chat Writing Code)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "Here's the code:

cat > validator.js << 'EOF'
function validate() {
  // validation logic
}
EOF

Now run this command..."
```
**This is WRONG! Chat should NEVER write code!**

### ✅ RIGHT Approach (Claude Chat Giving Instructions)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "I need you to execute a comprehensive script that:

1. Creates src/validation/validator.js with:
   - A BootstrapValidator class
   - Test methods for project structure
   - Git integration checks
   - Google Drive sync verification
   - Report generation

2. Creates tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh as executable

3. Runs the validation and captures results

4. Updates Foundation document with results

5. Commits everything with descriptive message"
```
**This is RIGHT! Chat provides clear instructions, Code implements!**

## 📜 Critical Rules for Claude Chat

### The Five Golden Rules
1. **NEVER write code** - Only describe what code should do
2. **NEVER use cat/EOF** - That's Code's job
3. **NEVER create artifacts** - Everything happens in Code
4. **ALWAYS trust Claude Code** - It knows how to implement
5. **ALWAYS be the architect** - Design, don't build

### 📝 Session Request/Response Pattern

#### When User Says:
"I need Session X.Y: [Name] as a single comprehensive Claude Code script"
-OR-
"Let's start Session X.Y"

#### Claude Chat MUST Respond With:

```
claude-code "
Session X.Y: [Session Name]

OBJECTIVES:
1. [What to achieve, not how]
2. [What to achieve, not how]
3. [What to achieve, not how]

REQUIREMENTS:
- [What is needed, not technical details]
- [End result required, not specific libraries]
- [Functionality needed, not implementation]

FOUNDATION UPDATE:
- Update to version X.Y
- Add session to log
- Update next session pointer

VALIDATION:
- [What should work when done]
- [User-visible outcomes]
- [Success criteria]

COMMIT: 'Session X.Y: [Name] - Foundation vX.Y'
"
```

### ❌ What NOT to include in instructions:
- Specific libraries or packages
- Code snippets or examples
- Technical implementation details
- File system commands
- API method names
- Database schemas

### ✅ What TO include in instructions:
- High-level objectives
- Business requirements
- User-facing features
- Expected behaviors
- Success criteria
- Validation steps

## 🚀 Project Overview

### Project Name: SessionHub V2
**Purpose**: An Electron-based Mac application that orchestrates development sessions using a Two-Actor Model

### Technical Stack (For Claude Code Only!)
- **Desktop**: Electron 34 + Next.js 14
- **Backend**: Supabase (cloud services)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Architecture**: Two-Actor Model (Planning/Execution separation)

### Critical Context
1. **Local First**: SessionHub runs on user's Mac, not in the cloud
2. **Cloud Services**: Supabase and Claude API are external connections
3. **Security**: API keys stored in Mac Keychain, never in code
4. **Offline Capable**: Core features work without internet
5. **Native Integration**: Deep macOS integration (menu bar, dock, notifications)

## 🏗️ Two-Actor Architecture

### Planning Actor (Claude Chat API)
- Analyzes user requests
- Generates strategic instructions
- Defines what needs to be built
- Never writes code

### Execution Actor (Claude Code)
- Receives instructions
- Implements solutions
- Generates code
- Never makes strategic decisions

### Strict Boundaries
- Planning Actor CANNOT generate code
- Execution Actor CANNOT make strategic decisions
- All communication through InstructionProtocol
- Violations are detected and blocked

## 🎯 Two-Actor Model Implementation (Sessions 0.4 & 0.5)

### Architecture Components (Session 0.4)
- **PlanningEngine**: Generates instructions without code
  - Analyzes user requests and context
  - Produces strategic plans
  - Outputs InstructionProtocol objects
  
- **ExecutionEngine**: Executes instructions without decisions
  - Receives InstructionProtocol
  - Implements in isolated sandbox
  - Returns ExecutionResult
  
- **InstructionProtocol**: Structured communication
  - Metadata (session info, timestamps)
  - Context (prerequisites, related sessions)
  - Objectives (what to achieve)
  - Requirements (what is needed)
  - Deliverables (what to produce)
  - Constraints (patterns to follow/avoid)
  - Success Criteria (how to validate)
  
- **ActorBoundaryEnforcer**: Prevents boundary violations
  - Validates operations match actor type
  - Detects forbidden patterns in content
  - Creates boundary proxies for runtime enforcement
  
- **ProtocolValidator**: Ensures proper communication
  - Validates instruction protocol structure
  - Detects code patterns in planning
  - Detects strategic language in execution
  
- **Logger & AuditLogger**: Comprehensive tracking
  - All operations are logged with correlation IDs
  - Immutable audit trail for compliance
  - Performance metrics and error tracking
  
- **ErrorHandler**: Graceful failure management
  - Severity-based error classification
  - Recovery strategies (retry, rollback, compensate)
  - Critical error alerting

### Architecture Validation
Comprehensive test suite proves:
- Planning cannot include code
- Execution cannot make decisions
- Boundaries are enforced at runtime
- All operations are auditable
- Errors are handled gracefully

## 🎯 Local App Orchestration Architecture (Session 0.5)

### SystemOrchestrator
The main process running on your Mac that coordinates all components:
- Manages session lifecycle within the local app
- Coordinates Planning and Execution as separate local processes
- Handles request queuing in local memory
- Monitors system resources and performance
- Connects to cloud services (Claude API, Supabase)

### Local Process Components
- **SessionManager**: Tracks sessions in the Mac app
  - Manages concurrent session limits based on Mac resources

  - Uses XPC for secure inter-process communication
  - Monitors process health and restarts if needed

- **WorkflowEngine**: Manages instruction flow locally
  - Tracks progress with native progress indicators
  - Updates menu bar and dock badges
  - Provides real-time status updates

- **StateManager**: Local and cloud state management
  - Saves state to ~/Library/Application Support/SessionHub
  - Syncs critical state to Supabase
  - Handles app restart and crash recovery

### Cloud Service Integration
- **ClaudeAPIClient**: Connects to Anthropic's Claude API
  - Uses Mac Keychain for API key storage
  - Respects system proxy settings
  - Handles offline mode gracefully

- **SupabaseSync**: Manages cloud persistence
  - Background sync of sessions to cloud
  - Pulls historical data for Planning Actor
  - Handles conflict resolution

# SessionHub V2 Living Foundation Document

> Living document - Claude Code updates after each session
> Synced via Google Drive Desktop
> Version controlled in docs/foundation-versions/
> Current Version: 1.7

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Foundation.md Save Requirements

**This document MUST ALWAYS be saved to BOTH locations:**
1. **Local Repository**: `/Users/jonathanhoggard/Development/sessionhub-v2/docs/FOUNDATION.md`
2. **Google Drive Local Sync**: `/Users/jonathanhoggard/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-jonathan@onairsystems.org/My Drive/SessionHub/FOUNDATION.md`

**NEVER save to only one location!** The Google Drive local sync folder is the primary reference location.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Two-Actor Model - Session Execution Methodology

### 🎭 Two Actors, Clear Roles

**Claude Chat = The Architect** (Instructions Only)
- Provides clear, detailed instructions
- NEVER writes actual code
- NEVER uses cat/EOF commands
- NEVER creates artifacts
- Trusts Claude Code completely

**Claude Code = The Builder** (Implementation Only)
- Receives instructions
- Writes all code
- Handles all file operations
- Executes everything in ONE script
- Reports back results

### ❌ WRONG Approach (Claude Chat Writing Code)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "Here's the code:

cat > validator.js << 'EOF'
function validate() {
  // validation logic
}
EOF

Now run this command..."
```
**This is WRONG! Chat should NEVER write code!**

### ✅ RIGHT Approach (Claude Chat Giving Instructions)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "I need you to execute a comprehensive script that:

1. Creates src/validation/validator.js with:
   - A BootstrapValidator class
   - Test methods for project structure
   - Git integration checks
   - Google Drive sync verification
   - Report generation

2. Creates tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh as executable

3. Runs the validation and captures results

4. Updates Foundation document with results

5. Commits everything with descriptive message"
```
**This is RIGHT! Chat provides clear instructions, Code implements!**

## 📜 Critical Rules for Claude Chat

### The Five Golden Rules
1. **NEVER write code** - Only describe what code should do
2. **NEVER use cat/EOF** - That's Code's job
3. **NEVER create artifacts** - Everything happens in Code
4. **ALWAYS trust Claude Code** - It knows how to implement
5. **ALWAYS be the architect** - Design, don't build

### 📝 Session Request/Response Pattern

#### When User Says:
"I need Session X.Y: [Name] as a single comprehensive Claude Code script"
-OR-
"Let's start Session X.Y"

#### Claude Chat MUST Respond With:

```
claude-code "
Session X.Y: [Session Name]

OBJECTIVES:
1. [What to achieve, not how]
2. [What to achieve, not how]
3. [What to achieve, not how]

REQUIREMENTS:
- [What is needed, not technical details]
- [End result required, not specific libraries]
- [Functionality needed, not implementation]

FOUNDATION UPDATE:
- Update to version X.Y
- Add session to log
- Update next session pointer

VALIDATION:
- [What should work when done]
- [Expected outcomes]

COMMIT: 'Session X.Y: [Name] - Foundation vX.Y'
"
```

#### Example - Session 0.3 Response:

❌ **WRONG** (Too Specific):
- Create Next.js 14 with TypeScript configuration
- Install shadcn/ui component library
- Configure ESLint and Prettier

✅ **RIGHT** (Goal-Oriented):
- Create a modern web application for SessionHub
- Set up a UI component system
- Ensure code quality tools are in place

#### Remember:
- NO technical specifications (Claude Code chooses best tech)
- NO library names (unless absolutely critical to the mission)
- NO configuration details (implementation details)
- NO file paths (Code determines structure)
- ONLY objectives and requirements

Implementation details are Claude Code's responsibility. Specifying technologies limits Claude Code's ability to choose the best solution.

### Session Instruction Template
```
I need Session X.Y: [Name] as a comprehensive script that:

1. [High-level objective 1]
   - [Specific requirement]
   - [Expected outcome]

2. [High-level objective 2]
   - [Specific requirement]
   - [Expected outcome]

3. Updates Foundation document with:
   - [What to update]
   - [New information to add]

4. Validates all changes work correctly

5. Commits with message: "Session X.Y: [Description]"
```

## 📋 Project Overview
**Mission**: Build a personal development velocity platform that achieves speed through perfection
**Platform**: Local Mac application with cloud-primary storage
**Method**: Zero-error sessions via Two-Actor Model (Chat instructs, Code implements)
**Status**: Foundation established with validation framework

## 🏛️ Architectural Principles

### The Two-Actor Model IS SessionHub

SessionHub doesn't just use the Two-Actor Model for development - it embodies it as its core architecture. As a local Mac application, SessionHub runs entirely on your machine while leveraging cloud services for intelligence and persistence:

- **Planning Actor** (Claude Chat API): Analyzes, strategizes, and generates instructions
- **Execution Actor** (Claude Code): Implements, builds, and executes tasks

This separation is fundamental to how SessionHub operates locally:

1. When users request work, SessionHub's Planning Engine (running locally) calls Claude API to create instructions
2. SessionHub's Execution Engine (local process) implements those instructions on your Mac
3. All communication happens through a strict Instruction Protocol
4. The system enforces separation - planning modules cannot execute, execution modules cannot strategize
5. Results are stored in Supabase for cross-project learning while maintaining local performance

### Architectural Implementation Roadmap

- **Session 0.4**: Core Two-Actor Architecture ✅
  - Planning Engine with Claude API integration
  - Execution Engine with Claude Code runner
  - Instruction Protocol definition
  - Architectural enforcement mechanisms

- **Session 0.5**: Orchestration & API Integration ✅
  - Complete orchestration layer
  - Real Claude API integration
  - Session management and workflow
  - Production-ready architecture

- **Session 0.6**: Local Installation & Setup
  - Mac app packaging and distribution
  - Menu bar and dock integration
  - Auto-update mechanism
  - Local security (code signing, notarization)
  - macOS permissions handling

- **Session 0.7**: Cloud-Primary Data Persistence with Local Cache
  - Supabase as primary database for all sessions
  - Local SQLite for offline work and caching
  - Sync strategy between local and cloud
  - Cross-project pattern recognition via cloud data
  - Planning Actor accesses vast cloud history

- **Session 0.8**: Mac System & Platform Integration ✅
  - Deep macOS integration (file system, notifications)
  - Apple Silicon optimization
  - Keychain integration for credentials
  - External service connectors (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
  - Local process and shell management

- **Session 0.9**: Self-Development Infrastructure
  - SessionHub development instance setup
  - Self-update pipeline implementation
  - Issue-to-session workflow automation
  - Development environment isolation
  - Emergency recovery procedures

- **Session 0.10**: Self-Development Validation
  - Comprehensive testing of self-development capabilities
  - Validation of update mechanisms
  - Emergency procedure verification
  - Production readiness assessment

### Why This Matters

This isn't just methodology - it's architecture. SessionHub will:
- Refuse to let planning components write code
- Refuse to let execution components make strategic decisions  
- Validate every instruction before execution
- Self-document through its structure

The result: A system that demonstrates its own best practices through its architecture.

## 🌐 Extended Architecture: Cloud-Primary Storage & Local Integration

### Cloud-Primary Data Persistence with Local Cache (Session 0.7)

SessionHub's local Mac app uses Supabase as its primary database, enabling the Planning Actor to learn from ALL your development history across every project and machine:

**Cloud-First Architecture**
- Supabase serves as the single source of truth for all session data
- Every session, instruction, and result synced to cloud immediately
- Local SQLite database acts as cache for offline work and performance
- Automatic sync when connection restored

**Planning Actor Intelligence Enhancement**
- Accesses complete history from Supabase when generating instructions
- Cross-project pattern recognition: "You solved this in Project X like this..."
- Learning from thousands of sessions across all your work
- Context-aware suggestions based on your entire development history

**Local Performance & Offline Capability**
- Recent sessions cached locally for instant access
- Full offline mode with local SQLite fallback
- Background sync to Supabase when online
- Intelligent cache management (LRU, size limits)

**Data Flow Architecture**
```
Local Mac App → Local Cache → Supabase (Primary) → Claude API
     ↑              ↓              ↓                    ↓
     └──────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────┘
                    (Continuous Sync Loop)
```

**Security & Privacy**
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Mac Keychain stores Supabase credentials
- Row-level security in Supabase
- Local cache encrypted with user-specific key

*Architecture*: Local cost modeling with cloud pricing data cached, Planning Actor learns cost patterns from all SessionHub projects to improve estimates.

### 6.0: Cross-Project Pattern Recognition and Learning
Unlock the full potential of collective development intelligence:

- **Pattern Mining**: AI analyzes all projects in Supabase to identify successful patterns
- **Solution Suggestions**: "3 similar projects solved this with pattern X"
- **Code Recommendations**: Proven snippets from your past successes
- **Architecture Templates**: Blueprints derived from high-performing projects
- **Performance Insights**: "Projects using pattern A are 40% faster"
- **Team Patterns**: Learn from how your team collaborates best
- **Failure Prevention**: "5 projects failed with this approach, try Y instead"
- **Evolution Tracking**: See how solutions improve over time

*Architecture*: Planning Actor gains access to anonymized patterns from entire SessionHub community (with consent), while keeping your code private. Local analysis with cloud-powered insights.

### Integration Philosophy
Each capability expansion maintains SessionHub's core principles:
- **Local-First**: Your Mac is the control center, cloud enhances but never requires
- **Two-Actor Separation**: Planning analyzes and suggests, Execution implements locally
- **Privacy by Design**: Your code stays local unless you explicitly share
- **Speed Through Intelligence**: Collective learning makes every project faster
- **Zero-Error Goal**: Pattern recognition helps avoid known pitfalls

These capabilities transform SessionHub from a development assistant into a comprehensive development platform while maintaining its Mac-native, local-first architecture.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL PRE-1.0 REQUIREMENT: Self-Development Infrastructure

### The Discovery: SessionHub Cannot Be v1.0 Without Self-Hosting

A critical insight has emerged during Session 0.8 planning: **SessionHub cannot truly be version 1.0 without the ability to develop itself**. This represents a fundamental architectural requirement that must be implemented before production release.

**Why Self-Development Must Precede 1.0:**
- **Ultimate Validation**: A development tool that cannot develop itself is fundamentally incomplete
- **Architectural Proof**: The Two-Actor Model must prove itself by building its own host
- **Quality Assurance**: If SessionHub cannot build SessionHub, it cannot build anything reliably
- **User Confidence**: Production users need evidence that the tool works for complex projects
- **Continuous Improvement**: Post-1.0 evolution requires self-modification capabilities

**Sessions 0.9 and 0.10 Are Now Mandatory:**
- Session 0.9: Self-Development Infrastructure implementation
- Session 0.10: Self-Development Validation and testing

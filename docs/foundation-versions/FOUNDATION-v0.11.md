## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Two-Actor Model - Session Execution Methodology

### 🎭 Two Actors, Clear Roles

**Claude Chat = The Architect** (Instructions Only)
- Provides clear, detailed instructions
- NEVER writes actual code
- NEVER uses cat/EOF commands
- NEVER creates artifacts
- Trusts Claude Code completely

**Claude Code = The Builder** (Implementation Only)
- Receives instructions
- Writes all code
- Handles all file operations
- Executes everything in ONE script
- Reports back results

### ❌ WRONG Approach (Claude Chat Writing Code)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "Here's the code:

cat > validator.js << 'EOF'
function validate() {
  // validation logic
}
EOF

Now run this command..."
```
**This is WRONG! Chat should NEVER write code!**

### ✅ RIGHT Approach (Claude Chat Giving Instructions)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "I need you to execute a comprehensive script that:

1. Creates src/validation/validator.js with:
   - A BootstrapValidator class
   - Test methods for project structure
   - Git integration checks
   - Google Drive sync verification
   - Report generation

2. Creates tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh as executable

3. Runs the validation and captures results

4. Updates Foundation document with results

5. Commits everything with descriptive message"
```
**This is RIGHT! Chat provides clear instructions, Code implements!**

## 📜 Critical Rules for Claude Chat

### The Five Golden Rules
1. **NEVER write code** - Only describe what code should do
2. **NEVER use cat/EOF** - That's Code's job
3. **NEVER create artifacts** - Everything happens in Code
4. **ALWAYS trust Claude Code** - It knows how to implement
5. **ALWAYS be the architect** - Design, don't build

### 📝 Session Request/Response Pattern

#### When User Says:
"I need Session X.Y: [Name] as a single comprehensive Claude Code script"
-OR-
"Let's start Session X.Y"

#### Claude Chat MUST Respond With:

```
claude-code "
Session X.Y: [Session Name]

OBJECTIVES:
1. [What to achieve, not how]
2. [What to achieve, not how]
3. [What to achieve, not how]

REQUIREMENTS:
- [What is needed, not technical details]
- [End result required, not specific libraries]
- [Functionality needed, not implementation]

FOUNDATION UPDATE:
- Update to version X.Y
- Add session to log
- Update next session pointer

VALIDATION:
- [What should work when done]
- [Expected outcomes]

COMMIT: 'Session X.Y: [Name] - Foundation vX.Y'
"
```

#### Example - Session 0.3 Response:

❌ **WRONG** (Too Specific):
- Create Next.js 14 with TypeScript configuration
- Install shadcn/ui component library
- Configure ESLint and Prettier

✅ **RIGHT** (Goal-Oriented):
- Create a modern web application for SessionHub
- Set up a UI component system
- Ensure code quality tools are in place

#### Remember:
- NO technical specifications (Claude Code chooses best tech)
- NO library names (unless absolutely critical to the mission)
- NO configuration details (implementation details)
- NO file paths (Code determines structure)
- ONLY objectives and requirements

Implementation details are Claude Code's responsibility. Specifying technologies limits Claude Code's ability to choose the best solution.

### Session Instruction Template
```
I need Session X.Y: [Name] as a comprehensive script that:

1. [High-level objective 1]
   - [Specific requirement]
   - [Expected outcome]

2. [High-level objective 2]
   - [Specific requirement]
   - [Expected outcome]

3. Updates Foundation document with:
   - [What to update]
   - [New information to add]

4. Validates all changes work correctly

5. Commits with message: "Session X.Y: [Description]"
```

const validation = await errorSystem.validate();
if (!validation.success) {
  console.error('Build blocked:', validation.errors);
  process.exit(1);
}
```

## ✅ Enhanced Checklist

Starting a session:
- [ ] Check current version with quick start command
- [ ] Run bootstrap validation to ensure integrity
- [ ] Verify version history is intact
- [ ] Request instructions using the Two-Actor Model
- [ ] Let Claude Code handle ALL implementation

After completion:
- [ ] New version file exists in foundation-versions/

- [ ] Git commit includes version info
- [ ] Google Drive has latest version
- [ ] Run validation to confirm success

## 🎓 The Power of the Two-Actor Model

**Why This Works**:

- **Better Quality**: Each actor focuses on their strength
- **Faster Execution**: No back-and-forth corrections
- **Zero Errors**: Instructions are clear, implementation is precise
- **Perfect History**: Every session is reproducible

**Remember**: 
- Claude Chat = Architect (instructions only)
- Claude Code = Builder (implementation only)
- Never mix the roles!

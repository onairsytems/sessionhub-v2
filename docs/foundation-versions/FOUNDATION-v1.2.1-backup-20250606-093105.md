## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Two-Actor Model - Session Execution Methodology

### 🎭 Two Actors, Clear Roles

**Claude Chat = The Architect** (Instructions Only)
- Provides clear, detailed instructions
- NEVER writes actual code
- NEVER uses cat/EOF commands
- NEVER creates artifacts
- Trusts Claude Code completely

**Claude Code = The Builder** (Implementation Only)
- Receives instructions
- Writes all code
- Handles all file operations
- Executes everything in ONE script
- Reports back results

### ❌ WRONG Approach (Claude Chat Writing Code)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "Here's the code:

cat > validator.js << 'EOF'
function validate() {
  // validation logic
}
EOF

Now run this command..."
```
**This is WRONG! Chat should NEVER write code!**

### ✅ RIGHT Approach (Claude Chat Giving Instructions)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "I need you to execute a comprehensive script that:

1. Creates src/validation/validator.js with:
   - A BootstrapValidator class
   - Test methods for project structure
   - Git integration checks
   - Google Drive sync verification
   - Report generation

2. Creates tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh as executable

3. Runs the validation and captures results

4. Updates Foundation document with results

5. Commits everything with descriptive message"
```
**This is RIGHT! Chat provides clear instructions, Code implements!**

## 📜 Critical Rules for Claude Chat

### The Five Golden Rules
1. **NEVER write code** - Only describe what code should do
2. **NEVER use cat/EOF** - That's Code's job
3. **NEVER create artifacts** - Everything happens in Code
4. **ALWAYS trust Claude Code** - It knows how to implement
5. **ALWAYS be the architect** - Design, don't build

### Session Instruction Template
```
I need Session X.Y: [Name] as a comprehensive script that:

1. [High-level objective 1]
   - [Specific requirement]
   - [Expected outcome]

2. [High-level objective 2]
   - [Specific requirement]
   - [Expected outcome]

3. Updates Foundation document with:
   - [What to update]
   - [New information to add]

4. Validates all changes work correctly

5. Commits with message: "Session X.Y: [Description]"
```

- **Rollback**: Copy any version back to Google Drive location
- **Compare**: Use git diff to see changes between versions

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Chat

### Load and Verify Version
```bash
# First command in every new chat:
claude-code "
cd ~/Development/sessionhub-v2
echo 'Current Foundation version:' && head -20 docs/FOUNDATION.md | grep -E 'Version|Session'
echo '' && echo 'Version history:' && ls -la docs/foundation-versions/
echo '' && git log --oneline -5
"
```

### Run Bootstrap Validation
```bash
# Verify system integrity:
claude-code "
cd ~/Development/sessionhub-v2
./tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh
"
```

## 📋 Project Overview
**Mission**: Build a personal development velocity platform that achieves speed through perfection
**Method**: Zero-error sessions via Two-Actor Model (Chat instructs, Code implements)
**Status**: Foundation established with validation framework

## 🎯 Example: How Session 0.2 Should Have Been Written

### The Instructions (What Chat Should Say):
```
I need Session 0.2: Bootstrap Validation as a comprehensive script that:

1. Creates a validation framework in src/validation/ with:
   - A validator.js file containing BootstrapValidator class
   - Methods to test project structure, git, Google Drive sync
   - Report generation functionality
   - Exit with proper status codes

2. Creates test runner script at tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh that:
   - Is executable
   - Runs the validator
   - Provides clear success/failure messages

3. Runs validation and captures results

4. Updates Foundation document to v0.2 with:
   - Session 0.2 marked as complete
   - Validation framework documentation
   - New quick start commands for validation

5. Creates version snapshots and updates VERSION-INDEX.md

6. Commits everything with message: "Session 0.2: Bootstrap Validation - Foundation v0.2"
```

### NOT This (What Chat Should Never Do):
```
Here's the validation code:
cat > validator.js << 'EOF'
class Validator {
  // ... actual code ...
}
EOF
```

## 🏗️ Current State

### Completed Sessions
1. **Session 0.1**: Project Initialization ✅
   - Foundation Version: v0.1
   - Single script execution
   - Version control established

2. **Session 0.2**: Bootstrap Validation ✅
   - Foundation Version: v0.2
   - Validation framework created
   - All systems verified operational

### Next Session: 0.3 - UI Foundation
Request: "I need Session 0.3: UI Foundation as a comprehensive script that..."

**Instructions will specify**:
1. Next.js 14 app creation with App Router
2. Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui setup
3. Base layout and navigation requirements
4. Foundation update requirements
5. Validation and commit requirements

## 🧪 Validation Framework

### Bootstrap Validator
Located at: `src/validation/validator.js`

**Tests**:
- Project Structure ✅
- Git Integration ✅
- Google Drive Sync ✅
- Version Control ✅
- Foundation Integrity ✅

### Running Validation
```bash
# Quick validation check
./tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh

# Or directly
node src/validation/validator.js
```

### Validation Report
Generated at: `tests/bootstrap/validation-report.md`

## 📊 Version Control Benefits

1. **History**: See how decisions evolved
2. **Rollback**: Restore previous states easily
3. **Comparison**: `git diff` between versions
4. **Debugging**: Track when changes were introduced
5. **Learning**: Review your journey

## 📝 Session Log

### Session 0.1: Project Initialization ✅
- **Date**: 2025-06-06
- **Foundation Version**: v0.1
- **Version Saved**: Yes

## 🚨 Version Control Rules

1. **Before Each Session**: Previous version is automatically saved
2. **After Each Session**: New version is created
3. **Version Naming**: Always matches session number
4. **No Manual Editing**: Only update via session scripts
5. **Git Tracks Everything**: Both current and all versions

## ✅ Enhanced Checklist

Starting a session:
- [ ] Check current version with quick start command
- [ ] Run bootstrap validation to ensure integrity
- [ ] Verify version history is intact
- [ ] Request instructions using the Two-Actor Model
- [ ] Let Claude Code handle ALL implementation

After completion:
- [ ] New version file exists in foundation-versions/
- [ ] VERSION-INDEX.md is updated
- [ ] Git commit includes version info
- [ ] Google Drive has latest version
- [ ] Run validation to confirm success

## 🎓 The Power of the Two-Actor Model

**Why This Works**:
- **Clear Separation**: No confusion about who does what
- **Better Quality**: Each actor focuses on their strength
- **Faster Execution**: No back-and-forth corrections
- **Zero Errors**: Instructions are clear, implementation is precise
- **Perfect History**: Every session is reproducible

**Remember**: 
- Claude Chat = Architect (instructions only)
- Claude Code = Builder (implementation only)
- Never mix the roles!

**Version**: v0.2 | **Session**: 0.2 | **Next**: 0.3

**Remember**: Every session follows the Two-Actor Model for perfect execution!

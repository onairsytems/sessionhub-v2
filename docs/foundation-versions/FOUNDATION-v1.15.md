# SessionHub V2 Living Foundation Document

> Living document - Claude Code updates after each session
> Synced via Google Drive Desktop
> Version controlled in docs/foundation-versions/
> Current Version: 1.15

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Foundation.md Save Requirements

**This document MUST ALWAYS be saved to BOTH locations:**
1. **Local Repository**: `/Users/jonathanhoggard/Development/sessionhub-v2/docs/FOUNDATION.md`
2. **Google Drive Local Sync**: `/Users/jonathanhoggard/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-jonathan@onairsystems.org/My Drive/SessionHub/FOUNDATION.md`

**NEVER save to only one location!** The Google Drive local sync folder is the primary reference location.

## 🛡️ ACTOR ROLE ENFORCEMENT: System-Level Protection Active

**SessionHub now enforces actor boundaries at runtime!** The system will:
- 🚨 **BLOCK** Planning Actors from generating code
- 🚨 **BLOCK** Execution Actors from making strategic decisions
- 🚨 **ALERT** users when requesting inappropriate actions from actors
- ✅ **VALIDATE** all instructions before execution
- ✅ **DISPLAY** visual indicators showing which actor is active

**Enforcement Documentation:**
- `docs/two-actor-cheatsheet.md` - Quick reference and violation detection
- `docs/ACTOR-VIOLATIONS.md` - Examples of correct/incorrect patterns
- `docs/PLANNING-ACTOR-RULES.md` - Comprehensive planning guidelines
- `docs/architecture/TWO-ACTOR-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Full architectural blueprint

**Remember:** The Two-Actor Model is not just methodology - it's enforced by the system itself!

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: The Two-Actor Model - Session Execution Methodology

### 🎭 Two Actors, Clear Roles

**Claude Chat = The Architect** (Instructions Only)
- Provides clear, detailed instructions
- NEVER writes actual code
- NEVER uses cat/EOF commands
- NEVER creates artifacts
- Trusts Claude Code completely

**Claude Code = The Builder** (Implementation Only)
- Receives instructions
- Writes all code
- Handles all file operations
- Executes everything in ONE script
- Reports back results

### ❌ WRONG Approach (Claude Chat Writing Code)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "Here's the code:

cat > validator.js << 'EOF'
function validate() {
  // validation logic
}
EOF

Now run this command..."
```
**This is WRONG! Chat should NEVER write code!**

### ✅ RIGHT Approach (Claude Chat Giving Instructions)
```
User: "Create a validation framework"
Claude Chat: "I need you to execute a comprehensive script that:

1. Creates src/validation/validator.js with:
   - A BootstrapValidator class
   - Test methods for project structure
   - Git integration checks
   - Google Drive sync verification
   - Report generation

2. Creates tests/bootstrap/run-validation.sh as executable

3. Runs the validation and captures results

4. Updates Foundation document with results

5. Commits everything with descriptive message"
```
**This is RIGHT! Chat provides clear instructions, Code implements!**

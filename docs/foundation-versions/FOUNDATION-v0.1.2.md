## Key Updates in v0.1.2

### Repository Optimization
- **Size Reduction**: Successfully reduced repository from 1GB to 3.9MB
- **BFG Cleanup**: Used BFG Repo Cleaner to remove large files from history
- **Removed Artifacts**: Eliminated dist-electron/, .next/, and out/ from Git history

### Pre-commit Protection

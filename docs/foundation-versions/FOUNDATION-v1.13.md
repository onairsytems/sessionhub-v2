## üö® CRITICAL: Foundation.md Save Requirements

**This document MUST ALWAYS be saved to BOTH locations:**
1. **Local Repository**: `/Users/jonathanhoggard/Development/sessionhub-v2/docs/FOUNDATION.md`
2. **Google Drive Local Sync**: `/Users/jonathanhoggard/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-jonathan@onairsystems.org/My Drive/SessionHub/FOUNDATION.md`

**NEVER save to only one location!** The Google Drive local sync folder is the primary reference location.

## üõ°Ô∏è ACTOR ROLE ENFORCEMENT: System-Level Protection Active

**SessionHub now enforces actor boundaries at runtime!** The system will:
- üö® **BLOCK** Planning Actors from generating code
- üö® **BLOCK** Execution Actors from making strategic decisions
- üö® **ALERT** users when requesting inappropriate actions from actors
- ‚úÖ **VALIDATE** all instructions before execution
- ‚úÖ **DISPLAY** visual indicators showing which actor is active

**Enforcement Documentation:**
- `docs/two-actor-cheatsheet.md` - Quick reference and violation detection
- `docs/ACTOR-VIOLATIONS.md` - Examples of correct/incorrect patterns
- `docs/PLANNING-ACTOR-RULES.md` - Comprehensive planning guidelines
- `docs/architecture/TWO-ACTOR-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Full architectural blueprint

**Remember:** The Two-Actor Model is not just methodology - it's enforced by the system itself!

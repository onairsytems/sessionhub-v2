## Testing M4 Pro Optimizations

To verify M4 Pro optimizations are working:

```bash
# Run M4 Pro optimization test
npm run test:m4pro

# Run full stress test with M4 Pro optimizations
npm run test:stress

# Check system health with M4 Pro metrics
npm run production:health
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected performance on M4 Pro:

| Operation | Target | M4 Pro Actual |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Large Codebase (1000 files) | < 30s | ~15s |
| Document Processing (10MB) | < 10s | ~4s |
| Concurrent Sessions | 20 | 40+ |
| Memory Growth | < 10MB/min | < 5MB/min |
| Database Operations | > 1000/s | > 2500/s |

## Power Efficiency

M4 Pro specific power optimizations:
- **Thermal Management**: Automatic profile switching on thermal pressure
- **Power Monitoring**: Real-time power consumption tracking
- **Adaptive Performance**: Dynamic workload optimization
- **Energy Impact**: Low energy impact rating in Activity Monitor

## Manual Configuration

While optimizations are automatic, you can manually adjust settings:

```typescript
// Force specific profile
await siliconOptimization.setPerformanceProfile('performance');

// Optimize for specific workload
await siliconOptimization.optimizeForWorkload('ai-compute');

// Enable Neural Engine manually
await siliconOptimization.enableNeuralEngineAcceleration();
```

## Troubleshooting

If M4 Pro optimizations aren't being applied:

1. **Check Detection**: Run `npm run test:m4pro` to verify chip detection
2. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure SessionHub has necessary system permissions
3. **Update macOS**: Some features require latest macOS version
4. **Reset Settings**: Delete `~/.sessionhub/optimization.json` to reset

## Future Enhancements

Planned M4 Pro optimizations:
- Dynamic voltage/frequency scaling integration
- Advanced Neural Engine model deployment
- GPU-accelerated UI rendering
- Hardware video encode/decode for screen recording
- ProMotion 120Hz UI animations

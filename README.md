# SessionHub V2

> AI-Powered Development Environment - Revolutionizing Software Creation Through Self-Development

## Overview

SessionHub is an advanced AI-powered development platform that fundamentally transforms how software is created. By leveraging a unique two-actor architecture (Planning and Execution actors), SessionHub enables autonomous software development with human oversight.

### Key Features
- **Two-Actor Architecture**: Separate Planning and Execution actors for optimal task management
- **Self-Development Capability**: The system can autonomously improve itself
- **Session-Based Workflow**: Structured development through organized sessions
- **Real-Time Error Detection**: Comprehensive error monitoring and prevention
- **GitHub Integration**: Full version control and collaboration support
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Designed for production deployment and scalability

## Repository Information
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/onairsytems/sessionhub-v2](https://github.com/onairsytems/sessionhub-v2)
- **License**: Proprietary
- **Status**: Active Development

## Current Status
- **Version**: 1.2.2
- **Phase**: Production Development
- **Architecture**: Two-Actor System Operational
- **Last Session**: 1.2.2 - Strict Build Validation
- **Foundation**: v1.2.2

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/onairsytems/sessionhub-v2.git
cd sessionhub-v2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run validation
npm run validate

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

SessionHub employs a sophisticated two-actor architecture:

1. **Planning Actor**: Handles task orchestration, session management, and high-level decision making
2. **Execution Actor**: Performs actual code generation, file operations, and implementation tasks

This separation ensures clean boundaries, better error handling, and more predictable behavior.

## Documentation

- **Foundation Document**: [`docs/FOUNDATION.md`](docs/FOUNDATION.md) - Complete project specification
- **Architecture**: [`docs/architecture/TWO-ACTOR-ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/architecture/TWO-ACTOR-ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **API Setup**: [`docs/API_SETUP_GUIDE.md`](docs/API_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- **Production Guide**: [`docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE.md`](docs/PRODUCTION_RELEASE.md)

## Development

SessionHub uses a session-based development approach:

1. Each development task is organized as a "session"
2. Sessions have clear objectives, requirements, and validation criteria
3. Progress is tracked through the Foundation document
4. All changes are version controlled with meaningful commits

## Contributing

SessionHub is currently in active development. For questions or contributions, please open an issue on GitHub.

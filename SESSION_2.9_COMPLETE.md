  - Automated report generation with recommendations

### 2. ✅ Batch Operation Capabilities
- Implemented `MCPBatchProcessor.ts` with:
  - Queue-based processing using Bull with Redis backend
  - Support for test, deploy, update, validate, and execute operations
  - Concurrent processing with configurable concurrency limits
  - Rollback mechanisms for failed operations
  - Progress tracking with throughput calculation
  - Memory management and monitoring
  - Snapshot creation for recovery

### 3. ✅ Real-Time Monitoring System
- Built `MCPIntegrationMonitor.ts` featuring:
  - WebSocket server on port 8081 for live updates
  - Health status tracking (healthy, degraded, unhealthy, offline)
  - Performance metrics: response time, throughput, error rate
  - Hourly statistics with p50, p90, p99 percentiles
  - Alert triggering based on configurable thresholds
  - Integration dependency mapping

### 4. ✅ Automated Testing Infrastructure
- Developed `MCPAutomatedTestRunner.ts` with:
  - Cron-based scheduling for automated tests
  - Multiple fault injection scenarios
  - Load testing with configurable stages
  - CI/CD integration support
  - Baseline comparison and trend detection
  - Webhook notifications for results

### 5. ✅ Results Aggregation & Reporting
- Created `MCPResultsAggregator.ts` supporting:
  - Multiple output formats: JSON, HTML, CSV, JUnit, PDF
  - Trend analysis across test runs
  - Recommendations based on performance
  - Export capabilities for all aggregated data
  - Success rate tracking over time

### 6. ✅ Alert Management System
- Implemented `MCPAlertManager.ts` with:
  - Configurable alert rules and conditions
  - Multi-channel support (console, webhook, Slack, email)
  - Alert throttling to prevent spam
  - Escalation levels for critical issues
  - Alert history and acknowledgment tracking

### 7. ✅ Mock Service for Offline Testing
- Built `MCPMockService.ts` featuring:
  - Scenario-based mock responses
  - Configurable latency and error rates
  - Mock implementations for all 8 core integrations
  - Import/export of mock data
  - Call history tracking

### 8. ✅ Monitoring Dashboard UI
- Created `MCPIntegrationDashboard.tsx` with:
  - Real-time WebSocket connection for live updates
  - Health status visualization
  - Active alerts display
  - Test results summary
  - Integration performance metrics
  - Batch operation controls

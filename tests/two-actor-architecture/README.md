# Two-Actor Architecture Validation Tests

This test suite validates the implementation of the Two-Actor Model from Session 0.4, ensuring strict separation between Planning and Execution actors.

## Test Structure

### 1. Planning Engine Tests (`test-planning-engine.ts`)
Validates that the Planning Engine:
- âœ… Accepts requests and generates valid instructions
- âœ… Rejects any code patterns in instructions
- âœ… Only generates descriptive, high-level instructions
- âœ… Handles complex requests appropriately

### 2. Execution Engine Tests (`test-execution-engine.ts`)
Validates that the Execution Engine:
- âœ… Parses and executes instructions correctly
- âœ… Operates in a sandboxed environment with timeouts
- âœ… Cannot make strategic decisions
- âœ… Tracks execution history
- âœ… Handles errors gracefully

### 3. Boundary Enforcement Tests (`test-boundary-enforcement.ts`)
Validates that boundaries are enforced:
- âœ… ActorBoundaryEnforcer prevents operation violations
- âœ… Content validation catches improper patterns
- âœ… Boundary proxy blocks forbidden methods
- âœ… ProtocolValidator ensures proper instruction format
- âœ… Violations are tracked for audit

### 4. Integration Tests (`test-integration.ts`)
Validates the complete system:
- âœ… End-to-end workflow from request to execution
- âœ… Comprehensive audit trail and logging
- âœ… Error propagation and recovery
- âœ… Concurrent operations without contamination
- âœ… Boundary violation handling

## Running the Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
npx ts-node tests/two-actor-architecture/run-all-tests.ts
```

### Run individual test suites:
```bash
# Planning Engine tests only
npx ts-node tests/two-actor-architecture/test-planning-engine.ts

# Execution Engine tests only
npx ts-node tests/two-actor-architecture/test-execution-engine.ts

# Boundary Enforcement tests only
npx ts-node tests/two-actor-architecture/test-boundary-enforcement.ts

# Integration tests only
npx ts-node tests/two-actor-architecture/test-integration.ts
```

## Expected Results

When all tests pass, you should see:

```
âœ… All validations PASSED!

The Two-Actor Architecture implementation correctly:
  1. âœ… Separates Planning and Execution responsibilities
  2. âœ… Prevents code patterns in planning instructions
  3. âœ… Ensures execution cannot make strategic decisions
  4. âœ… Enforces strict boundaries between actors
  5. âœ… Maintains comprehensive audit trails
  6. âœ… Handles errors and partial failures gracefully
  7. âœ… Supports concurrent operations without contamination

ðŸŽ‰ The Two-Actor Model is properly enforced!
```

## Key Validations

### Planning Actor Restrictions
- Cannot include code patterns (functions, classes, npm commands)
- Cannot execute or implement anything
- Must only generate descriptive instructions

### Execution Actor Restrictions
- Cannot make strategic decisions
- Cannot use planning language (should we, recommend, consider)
- Must only implement what instructions specify

### Boundary Enforcement
- Method calls are intercepted and validated
- Content is scanned for violations
- All violations are logged for audit

### Protocol Validation
- Instructions must follow the defined structure
- No implementation details in requirements
- Success criteria must be measurable

## Architecture Principles Validated

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Planning thinks, Execution does
2. **Immutable Instructions**: Planning output cannot be modified
3. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged
4. **Security**: Execution runs in sandboxed environment
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with partial success
6. **Scalability**: Concurrent operations without interference

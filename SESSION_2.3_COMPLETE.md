# Session 2.3: MCP Server Infrastructure - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Session 2.3 has been successfully completed! We've built a comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server infrastructure within SessionHub, creating a secure, extensible, and user-friendly platform for integrations.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Core MCP Server Infrastructure

- ✅ 8 pre-installed core integrations (GitHub, Linear, Figma, Zapier, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, Slack)
- ✅ Search, filter, and category-based organization
- ✅ Real-time event system for UI updates

### 3. Security & Sandboxing
- ✅ Comprehensive security manager with permission controls
- ✅ Worker thread isolation for untrusted code execution
- ✅ Domain allowlist/blocklist for network requests
- ✅ Rate limiting per tool execution
- ✅ Input/output validation against schemas

### 4. Visual Integration Builder
- ✅ Point-and-click interface for creating integrations
- ✅ No coding required for basic integrations
- ✅ Form-based tool creation with validation
- ✅ Permission selection with clear descriptions

### 5. Developer SDK
- ✅ Fluent API with builder pattern
- ✅ Type-safe schema helpers
- ✅ Comprehensive validation utilities

## Integration Points
- ✅ IPC handlers registered in main/background.ts
- ✅ APIs exposed in main/preload.ts
- ✅ Type definitions added to renderer/types/window.d.ts
- ✅ UI pages created for server management and marketplace

## Security Features
- Sandboxed execution with Worker threads
- Permission-based access control
- Domain-based network restrictions
- Rate limiting for all operations
- Input validation against schemas
- Signature verification ready for production

## Foundation Updated
- Foundation.md updated to version 2.3
- Saved to both local and Google Drive locations
- Version backup created in foundation-versions/

## Next Steps Ready
The MCP Server Infrastructure is now fully operational and ready for:
- Adding custom integrations through the visual builder
- Installing integrations from the marketplace
- Developing custom integrations with the SDK
- Secure execution of MCP tools locally
- Community sharing of integrations

## Validation Checklist
- ✅ MCP server starts and runs locally without errors
- ✅ Can successfully register and manage integrations
- ✅ Visual builder allows creation of simple integrations
- ✅ SDK documentation and examples are functional
- ✅ Security boundaries are enforced for all integrations
- ✅ Integration marketplace foundations are in place
- ✅ Foundation.md updated to version 2.3
